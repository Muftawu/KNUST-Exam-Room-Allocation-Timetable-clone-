MOTIVATION:
    My Univerisity, (KNUST), Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology
    makes the life of students and other learning staff easier on campus in 
    examination periods by nicely compiling all of a students papers to be 
    written at the end of each semester in a single pdf file. 

-This file containes 
    * Student Name
    * Student Index Number
    * Name and Title of Paper 
    * Location of paper including 
        - College 
        - Building 
        - Room 
        - Floor
    * Start and End time
    * Date of examination 
    * QRCODE of the particular paper's necessary details 


-Each student is required to take a printed copy of this file to the examination Hall
for verification before he or she can be allowed to write the paper.

-I thought this would be a good learning experience for me and my tech journey. So I 
    started building after our final exams in my third year first semester I was able to implement all of the functionalities and features on my univeristy's
    website and I was really thrilled when everything came together perfectly.

Thanks for reading.
